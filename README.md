# Dockerfile Build Failure: Missing or Incorrect requirements.txt

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles where the build process fails due to issues with the `requirements.txt` file.  The initial Dockerfile contains a flaw that prevents successful execution of the `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` command.

The solution provides a corrected `Dockerfile_solution` that addresses the error.

**Error:** The original Dockerfile attempts to install Python packages using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, but there's no `requirements.txt` or incorrect path to the requirements file.

**Solution:** The corrected Dockerfile ensures the `requirements.txt` is included in the image and the path is correct before running the `pip3 install` command.
